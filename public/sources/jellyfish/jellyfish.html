<h2>The Jellyfish</h2>

Visible, invisible,<br>
A fluctuating charm,<br>
An amber-colored amethyst<br>
Inhabits it; your arm<br>
Approaches, and<br>
It opens and<br>
It closes;<br>
You have meant<br>
To catch it,<br>
And it shrivels;<br>
You abandon<br>
Your intent—<br>
It opens, and it<br>
Closes and you<br>
Reach for it—<br>
The blue<br>
Surrounding it<br>
Grows cloudy, and<br>
It floats away<br>
From you.<br><br>
