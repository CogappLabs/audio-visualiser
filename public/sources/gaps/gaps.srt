1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,040
I didn't think I could love without

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,120
language.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,559
She spoke some of my me and hers, but

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,280
there

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,080
were

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,160
gaps

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,240
in. We start

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,080
simply smiles the

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,920
same. The best are often simplest. And

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,160
we

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,719
are we make sense.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,960
We to live in each other's languages,

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,320
fixing our secondhand sentences with

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,280
laughs

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,760
and building

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,239
homes in phrases

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,760
only of us understand.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,480
The day when I how I felt. She sits from

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,520
me hugging

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,600
to I tell I love her

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,680
in language

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
and

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,400
she in mine

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,000
and we are together even when lose words

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,040
like water in hands. Hands holding,

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
squeezing Morse code messages, brushing

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,560
fallen eyelashes. Trees ready winter

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,640
weave them flow, fall

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,799
away because we don't every

30
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,170
word for us to find meaning.

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,680
[Music]

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,119
Now the gaps between

33
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,640
us are thousands of miles

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,159
long. We still try to cross

35
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,079
them with paper plain letters and words

36
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,759
we think about way too much.

37
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,640
You tell me it's

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,319
easier living in the gaps we left

39
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,280
behind than to

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,520
rebuild. While I live back in a

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,840
different

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,560
life, a different

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,480
language, feeling your absence stronger

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,360
than your presence.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,680
I

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,879
wonder what does this mean for us?
