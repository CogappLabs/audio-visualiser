<h2>IIIF Song</h2>

Struttin' down the street<br>
That's where we'll meet.<br>
(oo-yeah!)<br>
(oo-yeah!)<br>
<br>
Checkin' out the scene<br>
With that IIIF beat.<br>
<br>
Four corners of the globe<br>
All coming into view.<br>
One image, one time,<br>
Showing me and you.<br>
<br>
Library lovers, get down with the click.<br>
(uh-huh!) Images so fresh<br>
They'll make you wanna trip.<br>
<br>
Metadata magic, it's cookin' up a storm.<br>
Standardized delight, no need to reform.<br>
<br>
IIIF<br>
Bringin' life to the vibe,<br>
Come on!<br>
Universal language,<br>
Let’s ride the tribe.<br>
<br>
Zoomin' in and out,<br>
We ain't just readin’ text.<br>
Visuals so potent,<br>
It'll leave you perplexed.<br>
<br>
Digitize the moment, it's a visual buffet.<br>
Oh, yeah.<br>
Art and history<br>
Comin' out to play.<br>
<br>
Interoperability,<br>
What a joyful ring.<br>
Double-tap that image,<br>
Got the whole world on a string.<br>
<br>
Access for all,<br>
No need to stall,<br>
Get that high-res flavor,<br>
Standing ten feet tall.<br>
<br>
Archival dreams,<br>
They're all in the stream.<br>
With IIIF,<br>
Reality’s a meme.<br>
<br>
I kept bringing light to survive.<br>
Come on, you children.<br>
So, language,<br>
Let's rock to try.<br>
So read it now.<br>
We just read the text, you know,<br>
So potent it'll leave you perplexed.<br>
<br>
Step on the meat stall.<br>
Give that a rest<br>
For the steady ten feet tall.<br>
<br>
Walk out of the trees,<br>
They're all in the street.<br>
With IIIF,<br>
Reality's a meme.<br>
<br>
So far, it's bringing life to the bar.<br>
Come on.<br>
You are the sole language.<br>
Let's ride.<br>
Try.<br>
<br>
So maybe now<br>
We just read sex fiction.<br>
Supposedly you published.<br>
<br>
Come on, come on.<br>
Come on.<br><br>
