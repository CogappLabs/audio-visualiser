1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:07,500
Visible, invisible, a fluctuating charm, an amber-coloured

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,220
amethyst inhabits it.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,000
Your arm approaches and it opens and it

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,400
closes.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,380
You have meant to catch it and it

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:18,760
triples.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,380
You abandon your intent, it opens and it

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,640
closes and you reach for it.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,040
The blue surrounding it grows cloudy and it

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,480
floats away from you.
