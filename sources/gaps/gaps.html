<h2>The Gaps We Leave Behind</h2>

I didn't think I could love without language<br>
She spoke some of mine,<br>
Me a little of hers<br>
but there were - gaps<br>
<br>
In ____<br>
We start so simply<br>
____ smiles,<br>
The same ____<br>
The best ____ are often simplest.<br>
And we are ____,<br>
We make sense.<br>
<br>
We ____ to live in each other’s ____ languages<br>
Fixing ____ second-hand sentences<br>
With laughs and ____,<br>
Building homes<br>
In phrases only ____ of us understands.<br>
<br>
The day when I ____ how I felt<br>
She sits ____ from me<br>
Humming to ____.<br>
I tell ____ I love her in ____language<br>
And she ____ in mine<br>
<br>
And we are ____ together<br>
Even when ____ lose words<br>
Like water ____ in hands<br>
Hands ____ holding<br>
____ squeezing morse code messages<br>
____ brushing ____ fallen eyelashes<br>
____ trees ____ ready ____ winter<br>
We ____ them flow, ____ fall away<br>
Because we don’t ____ every word<br>
For us to find meaning.<br>
<br>
Now the gaps between us are thousands of miles long<br>
We still try to cross them<br>
With paper plane letters<br>
And words we think about way too much.<br>
<br>
You tell me it's easier<br>
Living in the gaps we left behind<br>
Than to rebuild.<br>
While I live back in a different life<br>
A different language<br>
Feeling your absence stronger than your presence<br>
And wondering<br>
What does this mean for us?<br><br>
